6. Your organization wants to combine structured transaction data with social media feeds for analysis. Why might a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse be more suitable than a traditional data warehouse? 
Lakehouses can store all data formats and support SQL-based analytics.
Traditional data warehouses do not support SQL queries.
Lakehouses require less storage space than data warehouses.

7. How does a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse differ from a typical data lake in terms of data processing capabilities? 
Lakehouses integrate SQL and Spark engines for advanced data processing.
Data lakes inherently support real-time analytics without additional tools.
Lakehouses automatically transform all data into structured formats.

8. What is a significant benefit of schema-on-read in Microsoft Fabric lakehouses compared to predefined schemas in traditional data warehouses? 
Schema-on-read allows for more flexible data ingestion and transformation.
Schema-on-read requires less storage space.
Schema-on-read ensures faster data retrieval than predefined schemas.

9. Your organization plans to train machine learning models using data from a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse. Which tool is most appropriate for performing this task? 
SQL analytics endpoint
Dataflows Gen2
Notebooks
