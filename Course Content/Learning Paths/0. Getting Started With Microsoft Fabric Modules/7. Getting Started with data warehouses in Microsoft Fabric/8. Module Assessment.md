Multifactor authentication (MFA)
Correct
3. What is the purpose of staging tables in the data loading process of a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse? 
To directly load all data into dimension tables
To archive old and unused data
To perform data cleansing, transformations, and validation before loading into final tables
Correct
4. What is a key advantage of using a star schema over a snowflake schema in a data warehouse design? 
Simpler queries due to fewer joins required between tables.
Correct
Better support for historical data analysis.
Less data redundancy due to normalization of dimension tables.
5. You are tasked with designing a data warehouse that will support detailed reporting across several timeframes and geographic locations. Which schema model should you consider? 
Star schema
