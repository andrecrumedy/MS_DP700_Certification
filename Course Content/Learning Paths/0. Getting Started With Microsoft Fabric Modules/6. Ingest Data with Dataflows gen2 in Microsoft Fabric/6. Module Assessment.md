1. What is a significant advantage of using Dataflows Gen2 for ETL processes in Microsoft Fabric over traditional data pipelines? 
Dataflows Gen2 support row-level security natively within Microsoft Fabric.
Traditional data pipelines provide a visual interface for data transformations using Power Query Online.
Dataflows Gen2 allows for reusable ETL logic, reducing the need for repeated data source connections.
Correct
2. After implementing a Dataflow Gen2, a data engineer notices that the data refresh time is excessively long. What could be a potential reason for this issue? 
Dataflows Gen2 automatically apply machine learning algorithms to the data.
Dataflows Gen2 are configured to extract data multiple times from the source.
Correct
The dataflow is configured to use a deprecated version of SQL.
3. To implement an ELT process using Dataflows Gen2 and pipelines, what is the correct sequence of actions? 
Transform data with a Dataflow Gen2, then load it using a pipeline
Incorrect
Extract and load data with a pipeline, then transform data with a Dataflow Gen2
Load data directly into Power BI, then transform using Dataflows Gen2
4. How do Dataflows Gen2 simplify data integration compared to traditional data pipelines? 
By supporting row-level security for sensitive data.
By automatically generating machine learning models for data analysis.
By providing a low-code interface that ingests data from various sources.
Correct
5. You are tasked with optimizing a data workflow that uses Dataflows Gen2. Which practice would help reduce data refresh time for slower sources? 
Scheduling the dataflow during peak usage times
Using manual execution for all data pipelines
Using Dataflows Gen2 to extract data once and reuse it
Correct
6. What makes Dataflows Gen2 particularly beneficial for data analysts in Microsoft Fabric? 
They eliminate the need for any data preparation before report development.
They provide full-fledged data warehousing capabilities.
They allow analysts to perform upstream data transformations for improved report performance.
Correct
7. In a Dataflow Gen2 process, what component is critical to ensure that transformed data is available for downstream analytics? 
Incorporation of machine learning models within the dataflow.
Automatic integration with Power BI dashboards.
A designated data destination for loading transformed data.
Correct
8. In a code review, you notice that the Dataflow Gen2 transformation logic is not yielding the expected results. What could be a reason for this discrepancy? 
The dataflow does not include integration with Azure Synapse Analytics.
The dataflow uses deprecated connectors for data sources.
The transformation steps are applied in the wrong sequence.
Correct
9. When integrating Dataflows Gen2 into a Data Pipeline, you notice that the data transformations are not applying correctly. What could be a potential issue? 
The Dataflow Gen2 is not correctly configured in the pipeline.
Correct
The data source is directly connected to Power BI.
The pipeline trigger is set to manual execution.
