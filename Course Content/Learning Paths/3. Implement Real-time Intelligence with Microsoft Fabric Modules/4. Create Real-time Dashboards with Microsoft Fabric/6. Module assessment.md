1. What is a critical component to ensure real-time data visualization in a newly created dashboard tile? 
Custom tile color scheme
Unique tile background image
Correctly configured KQL query
Correct
2. When configuring a Real-Time Dashboard in Microsoft Fabric, how can you ensure that users only see data they have permission to access? 
Use anonymous access for data access
Use pass-through identity for data access
Correct
Use dashboard editor's identity for data access
3. The Real-Time Dashboard for bike availability has become cluttered and difficult to navigate. What is the most effective strategy to reorganize the data for improved user experience? 
Organize the dashboard using multiple pages for different data types.
Correct
Increase the number of tiles per page to show more data.
Add a search bar for easy data location.
4. In a Real-Time Dashboard for tracking bike availability, you need to frequently update similar queries across multiple tiles. How would you use a base query to manage this efficiently? 
Use parameters in each tile query to dynamically adjust the data retrieved.
Define a base query that retrieves all necessary data, and reference it in each tile-specific query.
Correct
Write separate queries for each tile to ensure they only retrieve data needed by that tile.
5. Your organization uses Microsoft Fabric to monitor real-time data from various sources. You notice that similar logic is being written repeatedly across different tiles. How can base queries improve this situation? 
By reducing the number of tiles required on the dashboard.
By allowing each tile to display entirely different data unrelated to other tiles.
By consolidating shared logic into a single query that multiple tiles can reference.
Correct
6. While setting up a Real-Time Dashboard, you see that your tiles are not displaying any data. What might be missing from your configuration? 
A defined KQL query for each tile
Correct
A unique font style for each tile
A custom background image for the dashboard
7. When creating a Real-Time Dashboard in Microsoft Fabric, why is it recommended to use base queries when working with multiple tiles? 
To ensure each tile retrieves a unique set of data independently.
To avoid duplicating logic across multiple tiles and ensure consistent data retrieval.
Correct
To increase the refresh rate of the dashboard for real-time updates.
8. You notice that the Real-Time Dashboard displaying bike availability has become cluttered and difficult to navigate. What is the most effective method to reorganize the data for improved clarity and user experience? 
Organize the dashboard using multiple pages for different types of data.
Correct
Increase the number of tiles per page to show more data simultaneously.
Add a search bar for users to locate specific data.
9. You are tasked with designing a Real-Time Dashboard that effectively displays bike rental data for operational decisions. Which method should you use to organize the dashboard to allow easy navigation between different types of data? 
Organize the dashboard using multiple pages, each dedicated to a specific type of data.
Correct
Place all tiles on a single page with a detailed legend for explanation.
Use a single page with interactive charts for all data types.
