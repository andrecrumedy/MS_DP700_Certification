1. How do compute permissions differ from workspace roles in Microsoft Fabric's security model? 
Workspace roles are more granular than compute permissions.
Compute permissions allow for granular access control within specific compute engines, unlike workspace roles.
Correct
Compute permissions apply to all items in a workspace, while workspace roles apply only to specific data items.
2. Which feature is unique to OneLake data access roles in Microsoft Fabric compared to other security components? 
They provide access to modify workspace-level data items.
They can apply row-level security across all data items.
They allow security settings to be inherited by subfolders within a lakehouse.
Correct
3. A project team needs temporary access to a folder within a lakehouse for the duration of a project. How would you configure access for this scenario? 
Use item permissions to grant access to the entire lakehouse.
Assign the team the Contributor workspace role for broader access.
Create a custom OneLake data access role for the project team with access to the specific folder, and remove the role after the project ends.
Correct
4. Which step is crucial for ensuring that a newly created OneLake data access role functions properly for folder access? 
Enable workspace role inheritance for the new role.
Assign the role to users and ensure permissions are set for the intended folders.
Correct
Select the 'Manage access' option from the workspace settings.
5. A data engineer in your team needs the ability to create new Fabric items in an existing workspace and read all data in an existing lakehouse. Which workspace role would be most appropriate to assign to them? 
Viewer
Contributor
Correct
Admin
6. A data engineer is transitioning from a role where they needed to create items in a workspace to one where they only need to view and analyze data from a specific report. How should you adjust their permissions? 
Remove the engineer from the Contributor role and assign item permissions to the specific report.
Correct
Keep the engineer in the Contributor role and use OneLake data access to restrict access.
Assign the engineer a Viewer role across the whole workspace.
7. Your organization needs to configure data access in Microsoft Fabric for a new team of data scientists who require access to a lakehouse for model development and experimentation. Which security model component should you focus on to ensure they can access the data within the lakehouse using Apache Spark? 
Assign OneLake data access roles to provide access to specific folders in the lakehouse.
Incorrect
Configure workspace roles to assign the Contributor role to the data scientists.
Implement granular permissions within the Fabric compute engine for Apache Spark.
8. A user reports they cannot access a specific folder within a Fabric lakehouse despite being assigned a OneLake data access role. What might be a potential reason for this issue? 
The user has not been added to the workspace role.
The folder permissions were not inherited due to a misconfiguration in the role setup.
Correct
The user does not have item permissions for the entire lakehouse.
9. Your organization has several external partners who need to view specific reports in your Fabric workspace without having the ability to modify any content. Which workspace role should be assigned to them to ensure they can only view the reports? 
Viewer
Correct
Member
Admin
