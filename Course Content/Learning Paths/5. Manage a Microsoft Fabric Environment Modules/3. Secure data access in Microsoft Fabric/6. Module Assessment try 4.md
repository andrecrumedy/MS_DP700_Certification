It restricts data access to specific folders within the lakehouse.
It allows the application of row-level and column-level security directly on data stored in the lakehouse.
Correct
It enables users to authenticate through Microsoft Entra ID for access.
2. A data scientist reports they can access the lakehouse metadata but cannot read any data within it. What permissions might they be missing? 
Contributor access on the workspace
Read all SQL endpoint data
Correct
Admin access on the workspace
3. You are tasked with reviewing a OneLake data access role that isn't functioning as expected. Which component would you first verify? 
Ensure that the role includes item permissions for all data items.
Verify that the role has been enabled in the workspace settings.
Check that the role is correctly assigned to the necessary users or groups and folder permissions are correctly set.
Correct
4. A report creator is unable to build new reports in a workspace. Which permission might they be lacking? 
Admin role in the workspace
Viewer role in the workspace
Contributor role in the workspace
Correct
5. You notice that several users with a OneLake data access role cannot see the expected folders. What step might resolve this issue? 
Increase item permissions to include more data items.
Add the users to the Admin workspace role for comprehensive access.
Verify that the role is assigned to the correct user groups and check folder permissions.
Correct
6. A data engineer is transitioning from a role where they needed to create items in a workspace to one where they only need to view and analyze data from a specific report. How should you adjust their permissions? 
Keep the engineer in the Contributor role and use OneLake data access to restrict access.
Assign the engineer a Viewer role across the whole workspace.
Remove the engineer from the Contributor role and assign item permissions to the specific report.
Correct
7. How does Microsoft Fabric's multi-layer security model ensure data security at the data security level? 
It relies solely on OneLake data access controls to secure data.
It applies workspace roles, item permissions, and granular permissions to manage data access.
Correct
It only uses Microsoft Entra ID authentication to control access.
8. A project team needs temporary access to a folder within a lakehouse for the duration of a project. How would you configure access for this scenario? 
Create a custom OneLake data access role for the project team with access to the specific folder, and remove the role after the project ends.
Use item permissions to grant access to the entire lakehouse.
Incorrect
Assign the team the Contributor workspace role for broader access.
9. A data engineer at your company needs to transition from creating Fabric items to only viewing specific lakehouse data. Which configuration change should you apply in Microsoft Fabric to meet this requirement? 
Assign the engineer the Admin role in the workspace.
Grant the engineer Read All SQL endpoint data permission for all data items in the workspace.
Remove Contributor role and configure item permissions for specific lakehouse access.
Correct
