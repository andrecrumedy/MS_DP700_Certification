1. When working with real-time data in KQL databases, which feature of materialized views helps ensure up-to-date query results? 
Automatic update of pre-computed aggregation results as new data arrives.
Correct
They store all data changes separately from the main database.
They eliminate the need for time-based filtering in queries.
2. Which KQL function is used to format a datetime column into a specific string format, such as 'yyyy-MM-dd'? 
format_datetime
Correct
to_string
convert_to_date
3. What is the significance of the 'summarize' operator in KQL when optimizing queries? 
It filters data based on specific conditions to improve query speed.
It organizes data by sorting it in ascending order.
It aggregates data, allowing you to perform efficient analysis on large datasets.
Correct
4. What is the primary advantage of applying time-based filtering early in a KQL query for real-time data analysis? 
It reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed by leveraging time-based indexing.
Correct
It increases the accuracy of the query results by focusing on more recent data.
It organizes data into separate storage locations based on event categories.
5. You are tasked with optimizing a KQL query that frequently performs complex joins between large datasets. How can stored functions assist in this scenario? 
By pre-computing join results for faster access.
By automatically updating join results as new data arrives.
By encapsulating join logic for reuse and consistency across queries.
Correct
6. Your organization uses KQL databases for analyzing real-time IoT sensor data. You notice that querying for daily average metrics is slow due to the large volume of incoming data. Which approach would best optimize the performance of these queries? 
Create a new KQL database for each day to isolate daily data.
Regularly delete old data to reduce the dataset size.
Create materialized views to store pre-computed daily metrics.
Correct
7. Your company needs to continuously ingest high-throughput data from an Amazon Kinesis stream into a KQL database. Which approach should be taken? 
Use a connector for non-Microsoft streaming sources.
Correct
Enable OneLake availability for the KQL database.
Manually upload data at regular intervals.
8. Your organization wants to integrate real-time streaming data from an external MQTT broker into a KQL database. Which integration method should you use? 
Use a non-Microsoft streaming source connector.
Correct
Enable OneLake availability for the KQL database.
Create a materialized view to capture streaming data.
9. When designing a KQL query involving joins, why should the smaller table be placed first? 
It automatically sorts the data, making the join operation faster.
It simplifies the query syntax, making it easier to read and write.
It minimizes the number of rows processed during the join operation, improving efficiency.
Correct
